# CATS!

These cats are all photographed by me (@maxogden) in various locales around the world, except for the ones marked named "kublai" which are 100% unsolicited photos of @calvinmetcalf's cat. No cats were harmed in the making of this git repository. All cats photos in here are BSD Licensed (EAST BAY WOOPWOOP)
